# Personal Webpage Portfolio
A personal webpage used to showcase my progress. Built using HTML and CSS. I am hoping to gain hands-on experience while working on the different ways to set up, style, and maintain this webpage.
## Why I Built This
I wanted to get hands-on experience while building this webpage from scratch so I could learn by building, breaking, fixing, and implementing new practices as I learn them. I hope to gain as much experience as possible with this project so I can apply my newfound knowledge to future projects.
